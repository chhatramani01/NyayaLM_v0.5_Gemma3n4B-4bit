## Introduction

In the heart of the Himalayas, Nepal stands as a nation of rich cultural diversity and complex legal traditions. Yet, beneath this beauty lies a persistent challenge: the inaccessibility of legal information for the majority of its citizens. With over 123 languages spoken and 60% of the population residing in rural areas, understanding legal rights and processes remains a privilege reserved for urban elites with access to legal professionals.

NyayaLM is our response to this challengeâ€”a fine-tuned language model based on Google's Gemma 3n, designed to provide accurate legal information in Nepali, running entirely offline on personal computers. This project represents our submission to the Google Gemma 3n Impact Challenge, demonstrating how AI can create meaningful, positive change in the world.

    model,
    finetune_vision_layers = False,
    finetune_language_layers = True,
    finetune_attention_modules = True,
    finetune_mlp_modules = True,
    r = 16,
    lora_alpha = 32,
    lora_dropout = 0,
    bias = "none",
    random_state = 3407,
)
```
## Dataset Preparation
We created a comprehensive dataset from 61 Nepali legal documents:
```python
from datasets import load_dataset
from unsloth.chat_templates import get_chat_template, standardize_data_formats
# Load and standardize the dataset
dataset = load_dataset("chhatramani/Nepali_Legal_QA", split="train")
dataset = standardize_data_formats(dataset)
# Format for Gemma-3 conversation style
tokenizer = get_chat_template(tokenizer, chat_template="gemma-3")
def convert_to_conversations(example):
    conversations = [
        {"role": "user", "content": example["instruction"]},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": example["output"]}
    ]
    return {"conversations": conversations}
dataset = dataset.map(convert_to_conversations)
# Apply chat template
def formatting_prompts_func(examples):
    convos = examples["conversations"]
    texts = [tokenizer.apply_chat_template(convo, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=False).removeprefix('<bos>') for convo in convos]
    return {"text": texts}
dataset = dataset.map(formatting_prompts_func, batched=True)
```
## Training Configuration
``` python
from trl import SFTTrainer, SFTConfig

trainer = SFTTrainer(
    model = model,
    tokenizer = tokenizer,
    train_dataset = dataset,     # Use full dataset
    eval_dataset = None,         # No evaluation
    args = SFTConfig(
        per_device_train_batch_size = 2,
        gradient_accumulation_steps = 8,            # Effective batch = 16
        warmup_steps = 100,
        max_steps = int(len(dataset) * 2 / 16),      # ~2 epochs
        learning_rate = 1e-5,
        logging_steps = 50,
        optim = "adamw_8bit",
        weight_decay = 0.01,
        lr_scheduler_type = "cosine",
        fp16 = True,
        seed = 1234,
        report_to = "none",
        save_steps = 200,
        save_total_limit = 2,
